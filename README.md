WormBase Website Repository
===========================

This repository contains the [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org) Web application.

**The repository for [WormBase Mobile](http://m.wormbase.org) can be found at [WormBase/website-mobile](https://github.com/WormBase/website-mobile)**

Installation
------------

Execute the following commands in a BASH terminal:

    git clone git://github.com/WormBase/website.git wormbase
    cd wormbase
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    export approot=`pwd`
    perl Makefile.PL FIRST_MAKEFILE=MakefilePL.mk
    make installdeps

Then, setup githook to automatically re-build the static assets _after checking out a branch_

    # Before setting up the automation,
    # run the following commands to ensure static assets can be built manually without error
    cd client/
    npm install  # alternatively, yarn install
    npm run build  # alternatively, yarn run build

    yarn --version  # check if Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com) is installed, install it if necessary

    # Setup githook that automates static asset re-build
    cd ..  # ensure you are at project root
    ln -s ../../githooks/post-checkout .git/hooks/post-checkout

- **Note**: **Only** works for checking out a branch. If you modify a JS or CSS file, or if you merge in changes involving JS or CSS, you still need to manually re-build with `npm install` (or `yarn install`) and `npm run build` (or `yarn run build`).
- `yarn` is mostly equivalent to `npm`. Yarn is required here, because `yarn install` is faster than `npm install`, hence can be run frequently, such as after `git checkout`.


If you did not start off in `/usr/local`, then you can either change the preset paths in the application's configuration files, or alternatively, carry out these two steps:

    sudo -E su
    cd /usr/local
    ln -s $approot

### Dependencies
Most backend dependencies will be installed with `make installdeps`, but `perl Makefile.PL` itself is depending on some prerequisites:

1.  a development environment: Perl, make, gcc & co.
2.  `sudo cpan Module::Install`

On Mac OS X, Perl comes preinstalled. The C development tools are installed from within Xcode, which is free, and then selecting from the menu/dialogs: Xcode -> Preferences... -> Downloads -> Components -> "Command Line Tools" -> "Install".

For client-side application (`client/`), Node.js (>=6) and NPM (>=3) needs to be installed . Once NPM is installed, addition dependencies needs to be installed by running `npm install` command in the `client/` directory.

Run the application in development
-----------------------
**First, build the static assets:**

    cd client/
    npm install  # alternatively, yarn install
    npm run build  # alternatively, yarn run build

- **Note**: You might see `npm install` and `npm run build` several times in this README. Here is some explanation:
    - The former needs to be re-run when and **only when** new (devD/d)ependencies are declared in client/package.json
    - The latter needs to be re-run when and **only when** a JS, CSS, or image file is modified
    - It’s always safe to do either command any time during development
    - The client/mode_modules and client/build folder contain only derived/auto-generated content. The client/node_modules folder is created and modified by `npm install`. the client/build folder is created and modified by `npm run build`. Both are considered safe to delete and recreate by calling the respective command during development. (So please don’t modify content of the folder manually, as the change won’t persist).
- **Note**: If you have setup a **post-checkout** githook to automate static asset re-build, you may skip this step when and **only when you checkout a branch**. This **does not help**, if you modify a JS or CSS file, or if you merge in changes involving JS or CSS. In those cases, you still need to manually re-build with `npm install` (or `yarn install`) and `npm run build` (or `yarn run build`).
- **Note**: If you are making changes to JS, CSS and images, you may want to automate and speed up the re-build step with instructions below to Setup development enviroment for JS and CSS development.

**Then, to run the app using the built-in Catalyst server:**

    # ensure you are at project root (for example `cd ..` if necessary)
    ./script/wormbase_server.pl -p 8000 -r -d

- **-p** port
- **-r** auto restart server, when change in code is detected
- **-d** debug

(Additional hightly recommended) Setup development enviroment for JS and CSS development
-----------------------------------------------------
By default, client-side assets (such as JS, CSS, and images) require a full re-build every time a change is made. This step is slow and requires the developer to manually enter `npm run build`.

**During development**, you might want to automate the process and speed things up. To do so, you can enable automatic incremental build by running a Webpack Dev Server. Catalyst server is configured to load static assets from the Webpack Dev Server (if it detects one) instead of the client/build/ folder in the local files system. Webpack Dev Server re-builds the assets when source code is modified.

**Note**: the webpack dev server does **not** modify the content in client/build (but only re-build and serve what is memory). To change the content, you will need to run `npm run build`.

To start Webpack dev server:

* On the same machine where Catalyst server is running, choose a free port MY_PORT_NUMBER (
different from the port that runs your Catalyst server). Then:

```
    cd client/
    PORT=[MY_PORT_NUMBER] HOST=[MY_HOST_URL] npm run start
```

* In wormbase_local.conf, set the URL of Webpack dev server (such as):

```
    webpack_dev_server = "http://dev.wormbase.org:[MY_PORT_NUMBER]"
```

Prior to deployment
----------------------
Re-build the static assets:

    cd client/
    npm install
    npm run build


Running the application via Starman
-----------------------------------

    starman --port 8000 --workers 10 wormbase.psgi


Unit Testing
------------

We provide two sets of unit tests for the REST API and WormBase Perl API respectively. The tests are based on [Test::More](http://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html), they run on a fully populated WormBase database backend, they autonomously start and stop a Catalyst web server (random port between 28,000 and 31,999).

Running REST API tests:

    perl t/rest.t


Running WormBase Perl API tests:

    API_TESTS=1 perl t/api.t

Running WormBase Perl API tests for just the gene class:

    API_TESTS=gene perl t/api.t

Running WormBase Perl API tests with blacklist

    API_TESTS=1 API_TESTS_BLACKLIST=gene:cds perl t/api.t

Comparative Testing
-------------------

For testing GBrowse installations, we provide a test implementation that compares `gbrowse_img` images to a reference set.

Running comparative GBrowse tests:

    perl t/gbrowse.t --base http://dev.wormbase.org:4466/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse_img

Creating a reference image set that is used for the comparative tests:

    perl t/gbrowse.t --base http://dev.wormbase.org:4466/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse_img --reference

A summary log and a full disclosure of broken URLs is written to the logfile `logs/gbrowse_test.log`.

Deployment with AWS ElasticBeanstalk Overview
----------------------------------------

AWS ElasticBeanstalk (AWS EB) allow us to deploy our multi-container build easily. It provides health monitoring, load balancing, rolling updates, etc.

Here, we highlight some important aspects for working with AWS EB.

### Credentials

Obtaining the appropriate AWS credentials and privileges is the prerequisite of performing many of the tasks below.

Please work with another WormBase developer to have your AWS account and privileges setup.

Your machine also needs to be configured with the credentials, and you will need to:
* have `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` properly configured, AND
* have environment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY correctly set

### Environments

We maintain two kinds of deployments on EB:

* A perpetual staging environment
* A release specific production

It’s important to know which environment you are working with, when making changes to a deployment.

To learn about their differences and how to work with them, please read the Staging Deployment and Production Deployment sections below, as well as parts of the Makefile, in particular tasks such as `make eb-create`, `make production-deploy`, and `make staging-deploy`.


### Configuration

While the EB web management console provides easy ways to experimenting with configuration options, we consider the _source of truth_ for configuration to be:
* saved configuration used by `make eb-create`, AND
* configurations in [.ebextensions/](.ebextensions/)

Staging ane Production configuration should be kept virtually the same to facilitate reproducibility and testing.

What this means in practice:
* Please test a configuration on staging environment before applying it to production environment
* If there is a configuration change that you applied through the WB web management console that you intent to keep (to future builds/releases), please make a “Saved Configuration” through the web management console, give a version name (like v.1.0), and update the Makefile task `eb-create` to use the new version (such as `--cfg v1.0`
* `.ebextensions` is intended for more obscure config options that’s not available through the web management console.


### Docker Containers

Website (Catalyst) code in this repository are running inside containers when deployed to Beanstalk.

For more details, please refer to the staging deployment and production elopement sections below, as well as the Makefile task `eb-create`.

### Data and File System access

Data associated with a particular release (such as data in ACeDB and BLAST) are deployed to EB through a mounted volume based on a volume snapshot.

**EB needs to be manually configured to use a volume snapshot for each WS release.**

A volume snapshot is created at the end of the "staging process" and is unique each release. The volume ID can be located from AWS console under Services > EC2 > Snapshots.

The exact configuration is done at [.ebextensions/01-setup-volumes.config](.ebextensions/01-setup-volumes.config).


Staging Deployment on AWS ElasticBeanstalk
---------------------------------------------

Staging deployment is mostly automated and continuously deployed. The only manual step is to inform EB of the correct volume (file system) snapshot to use for a particular WS release.

The file system contains data and certain scripts that aren't dockerized. For more details for data and File System access, refer to EB deployment overview section above.

Continuous deploying of the staging site to AWS EB is handled by Jenkins. It's triggered by commits to the staging branch on Github.

Jenkins runs the [jenkins-ci-deploy.sh](jenkins-ci-deploy.sh) script to deploy changes.

For detailed setup, please visit the Jenkins web console.

Production Deployment on AWS ElasticBeanstalk
---------------------------------------------

Deploying to production involves the following steps:

- change the release number in wormbase.conf
- Make a release
  ```
  # at the appropriate git branch for production
  make release
  ```

- Deploy to the pre-production environment

  ```console
  # at the appropriate git branch for production
  make eb-create

  # If ACeDB TreeView isn't working, which seems to be caused by a race condition
  # between setting up the file system and starting ACeDB container,
  # can generally be fixed by re-do the deployment step
  make production-deploy
  ```

- Swap the URL between the pre-production environment and the exiting production environment
	- This can be done through the web console of AWS ElasticBeanstalk.

- After making sure the new production environment is working, shut down the previous production environment
	- This can be done through the web console of AWS ElasticBeanstalk.


Applying Hotfix on AWS ElasticBeanstalk
-----------------------------------------

- Prior to applying the hotfix, ensure you are at the appropriate git branch for production.

- Then run the following commands,


	```
	VERSION=[GIT_TAG_TO_BE_CREATED] make release  # the tag should look like WS268.12
	make production-deploy
	```
